      <h1>Lesson 01 Assignment</h1>
        <p>As mobile web devices become increasingly commonplace and manufactured with smaller screens than standard desktop and laptop computers, and e-commerce becomes a lifeline for more and more public and private entities, solving web design issues related to responsiveness and adaptiveness is paramount for both users and hosts.</p>

        <p>Hosts of unresponsive, unaesthetic, and inefficient, lagging sites risk that mobile and smaller-device users will become frustrated and exit a site before pages load, the site is navigated, or a transaction is completed. As e-commerce becomes more commonplace, this is troublesome for businesses, governments, non-governmental entities, and others.</p>

        <p>In addition, keeping sites as clean and simple for the user and behind the scene in the code, allows for sites to load efficiently and properly for all users, including desktop and laptop users, as well use users that switch back and forth between device types, and those running older browsers.</p>

      <p>Responsive web design aims to solve several problems, including:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Making images and icons responsive: Simply using CSS properties such as width and max-width makes images and icons responsive and aesthetic to users.</li>

          <li>Displaying data on smaller screens: Making each row a table of its own when the window size is narrow allows data to display correctly on smaller screens.</li>

          <li>Adding responsiveness to fixed-width layouts: Consider a framework to add fluidity to a fixed-with layout to add responsiveness for users.</li>

          <li>Complex navigation menus: To optimize function for all users, keep the navigation simple and aesthetically pleasing.</li>

          <li>Supporting old browsers: Consider using a StatsCounter to find out if users are using outdated browsers and whether that use needs to be supported.</li>
        </ul>
